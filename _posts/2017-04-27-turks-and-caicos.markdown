The humidity caught me by surprise, just like it did last time I came to the Caribbean. Walking across the tarmac, I dutifully took out my new, and very cheap, Panama hat and placed it on my head. The customs line was short, the airport was small, and within a few minutes we were on our shuttle. Our driver name dropped Bruce Willis, Keith Richards, and Donna Karen, as people he drives often. They all have homes on the island where we were headed. 

It's not supposed to be this easy, to come to a place like this. In fact, without my flight benefits, this would have been way outside what we could afford. But with them, things like this, a private resort on Turks and Caicos only accessible by boat, become possible. At once I felt lucky, like I'd arrived, but also dirty, like we were cheating, indulgent imposters who were in over their heads. 

You know how sometimes football players celebrate a little too hard when the score a touchdown? It's almost as if they're surprised they made it there, are fearful they'll never make it there again. Or at least are insecure enough to want to make a show out of it, lest their doubters remain unclear on what's transpired. That's the very last thing I want for myself, on this island or in life. Never gawk at luxury because success is expected. I may never feel at home surrounded by luxury, but goddammit I'm going to do my best to make it seem that way. 


## Act like you've been there

The 20-minute ferry ride to the island featured a dolphin stop, and nobody else on the boat, save for our good-natured captain. Arriving at the dock we were greeted by two more people, hyper-welcoming and ready to serve. My every impulse was to politely decline their assistance and handle our bags myself, but I reasoned my way to allowing these gentlemen to do their jobs. 

The resort was easy-lux. Refined but without undue opulence. Not a gold toilet in sight. 

I've never been one for slogans. They've always struck me as inane, the currency of the not-too-bright. But as I gaze through my sunglasses at the radioactively blue Caribbean, I'm starting to come around. 

Before you fault me for thinking about marketing on the beach, I would remind you that we're living in the era of the Twitter President. The last 6 months have made it clear what sloganeering can do in our connected world, and it's impossible not to marvel. It's all got me thinking that perhaps I need a slogan myself, a personal credo -- something to remind me of first principles and keep me grounded, motivated, and inspired. 


## Assume Positive Intent 

If it weren't for empathy, I would be far more paranoid. One thing I've learned in life is that if you assume everyone is acting with a positive intentions, you'll almost always be right. Even with negative outcomes, it's rarely a productive use of time and energy to imagine nefarious motivations. Everyone just wants to protect their family, cover their ass, and feel like they're their own protagonist -- in that order. Assume they're simply trying to hit one of these goals in every interaction you have with them. 

Nobody wants to take you down. In fact, they don't care about you at all. You'd be shocked about how little other people think about you -- and when they do, it's mostly about how they've interacted with you, a completely separate thing from you as a person. 

Don't get me wrong, some people are just different. There are always outliers, maybe 5% of the population, who will take trust as weakness and look to take advantage -- sociopaths, criminals. But if you look first to see the good, you'll be right 19 times out of 20. That's a solid A in statistics. 


## Fear Only Evil Lincoln 

There's an episode of Futurama that includes a throw-away reference to a character known as "Evil Lincoln". It's a one-second gag that features our 16th President as an evil-looking hologram with an axe. That's all there is to it. Completely one-dimentional, completely random, completely unimportant in every way, and it makes me giggle every time. Repeating these words reminds me not to take myself too serously, because it's all bullshit in the end, and that the world may be a scary place -- but the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself, in the form of murderous robots.
