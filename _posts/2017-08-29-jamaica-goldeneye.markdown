Every few months or so I daydream about what it would be like to win the lottery,<sup>1</sup> something everyone does I imagine -- except maybe for people who have already won the lottery. I'd take care of all the normal things first, like pay off my debt (looking at you, American University), buy my mom a house, and consider a long vacation. 

And it'd probably look a lot like the vacation I'm on now. I'm on a deck, about the size of a 2-car garage, which opens on one side to our cottage, and the other a lagoon. Nearby is the villa where Ian Flemming wrote all the James Bond novels. It's about dusk and my girlfriend is going for a swim. This is <em>not</em> the kind of vacation I would want to take if I were to win the lottery.<sup>2</sup> I'd want to live like this every day.

<sup>1</sup> Most often from a spot on a rush-hour G train.

<sup>2</sup> As someone who understands probability, I tend to avoid lottery, so I'd like to formally substitute a World Series of Poker main event title.
