Every few months or so I daydream about what it would be like to win the lottery,<sup>1</sup> something everyone does I imagine -- except maybe for people who have already won the lottery, they're probably good. If I won, I'd take care of all the normal things first, like pay off my debt (looking at you, American University), buy my mom a house, and consider a long vacation. 

It'd probably look a lot like the vacation I'm on now. I write from a deck about the size of a 2-car garage, which opens on one side to our cottage, and the other a semi-private lagoon. Nearby is the villa where Ian Flemming wrote all the James Bond novels. It's about dusk and my girlfriend is going for a swim. This is <em>not</em> the kind of vacation I would want to take if I were to win the lottery<sup>2</sup>. As a millionaire, I'd want to live like this every day.




<sup>1</sup> Most often from a spot on a rush-hour G train.

<sup>2</sup> As someone who understands probability, I tend to avoid lottery, so I'd like to formally substitute a World Series of Poker main event title.
